OCR_with_EasyOCR_and_Python

OCR, or Optical Character Recognition, allows you to extract text from a document, whether it an image, a PDF, or a table. Using OCR, you may quickly extract this text for further processing, NLP, or integration into your existing workflow.

EasyOCR has the advantage of working with Python and being fairly accurate without any fine adjustment.


I was able to accomplish the following with this project:

1. Get EasyOCR and Pytorch up and running.

2. With Python, use EasyOCR to extract text from an image.

3. Use OCR to extract numerous lines of text and manage the results.

4. Using OpenCV, visualize the image's output.
